# Compare two revisions

## Steps

1. **Find the project.** If the customer says "this" or "the selected", call `get_selection` first. Otherwise
   use `list_projects` and `get_project`.
2. **Get the new drawings in.** If the newer revision is not in the project yet, call `add_plan_set`: the
   customer adds the files on the upload card. Wait until the card shows the sheets are read.
3. **Compare.** Call `compare_drawing_revisions`. It matches sheets by sheet number and reports each one as new,
   unchanged, changed or not checked, with the measured items on the changed sheets.
4. **Report.** Lead with the count of changed sheets, then list them by sheet number and title. Name the measured
   items that sit on changed sheets, since their quantities may need a new takeoff. To see the changes drawn on
   the sheets, the customer presses **Open**, or you call `open_exayard`.
5. **Next step.** If quantities may have changed, offer a new takeoff of the changed sheets. That goes through
   the proposal card and the customer's **Approve**, as every takeoff does.

## Rules

- Report "not checked" sheets as not checked; never call them unchanged.
- Plain words to the customer: no record ids and no tool names.
